# Automated-birthday-emailing
Sends an email with a congratulatory message and an irrelevant quote to friends on their birthdays. An email is sent to everyone whose birthday is that day, every time the program is run, not once a day.

Birthdays, emails, and names are stored in birthdays.csv

This program currently uses the email tatyana.automated@yahoo.com to send emails and can access inboxes with low security settings.

This is day 32 of the 100 days to python mastery challenge on Udemy.com

Enjoy!
